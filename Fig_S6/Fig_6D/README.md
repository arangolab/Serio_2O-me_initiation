# Analysis of translation efficiency

To evaluate the impact of 2'O-methylation of cognate AUGs on the translation of the canonical ORF, we downloaded the translation efficiency (TE) values of HeLa mRNAs reported in Arango et al., 2018 (GSE102113) [REF:27]. The plot was generated using the code TE_canonical.Rmd. The Markdown is TE_canonical.html. The data set needed to run the code is TE.AUG.canonical.csv
